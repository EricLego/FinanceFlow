# Migrations

This directory contains Alembic migration scripts used to manage database schema changes in the application.

## Files Overview

- **alembic.ini**  
  Contains the basic Alembic configuration. Note that the `sqlalchemy.url` is intentionally left blank because it is dynamically set by `env.py` based on the Flask application's configuration.

- **env.py**  
  Integrates Alembic with Flask-Migrate. It dynamically retrieves the SQLAlchemy engine and metadata from the Flask application, ensuring that migrations run against the correct database. This file supports both offline and online migration modes.

- **script.py.mako**  
  The Mako template used to generate new migration scripts. This file defines the structure for migration files, including the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions.

## Usage

- **Generating a Migration**  
  Run the following command to autogenerate a new migration script based on model changes:
  ```bash
  flask db migrate -m "Describe your changes"
